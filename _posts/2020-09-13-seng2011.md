## Predicate Translation

### Propositional Logic

  * Statements/propositions are declarative -- can be true or false and thus expressed in propositional logic.
  * Questions and imperatives aren't declarative -- cannot be true or false and thus expressed in propositional logic.

<br>

### Propositional Well-Formed Forumlas (WFFs)

  * Propositions in propositional logic are connected by operators to create forumlae. These formulae must be well-formed.
  <br>

  * A statement P is a wff.
  * P ∧ Q is a wff.
  * P ∨ Q is a wff.
  * P → Q is a wff.
  <br>

  * No temporality or natural arugments that involve properties/relationships in propositional logic. For example, "I am wet" is the same as "I will get wet".

<br>

### Implication

  * p → q: implication
  * ¬p → ¬q: inverse
  * q → p: converse
  * ¬q → ¬p ≡ p → q: contrapositive 

<br>

### Sufficient and Necessary

#### Sufficiency

  * If you have R, you will get S. For example -- **if** I rise early, I will see sunrise.
  * R → S.

#### Necessity

  * I will see sunrise **only** if I rise early. In this case, R is necessary for S.
  * ¬R → ¬S ≡ S → R.

#### Equivalence

  * I will see sunrise **if and only if** I rise early.
  * R → S ∧ S → R ≡ S ↔ R.
